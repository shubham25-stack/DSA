Problem Statement: Leetcode 48 no question.</br></br>
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).</br>
</br>
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix </br>and do the rotation.</br>

Approach:</br>
    Step 1: we had simply transpose the matrix.</br>
    step 2: we reverse by using the inbuit function that is </br>
        reverse(first.begin(),last.end()).</br></br>

    Step 3: we got our result by these method.... 
</br></br>
Time Complexity: O(n2) -: because of we used 2 </br>for loop for transposing the matrix.</br></br>

Space Complexity: O(1)</br></br>
